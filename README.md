How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?

I ensure security and functionality by writing clean, modular code, with a complete suite of unit tests verifying key functionality and error condition behaviors. I also follow safe coding practices such as checking user input and limiting exposure to the outside world to minimize vulnerabilities.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?

I read user needs by closely studying requirements, considering realistic usage situations, and ensuring program design meets functional and non-functional expectations. I also prioritize usability, error handling, and flexibility while relating requirements to code.

How do I approach designing software?

I develop software with simplicity, scalability, and maintainability in mind. I start by identifying critical features, modularizing for clarity, and planning for testing at each stage. User requirements, future extensibility, and conformity to industry best practices drive design decisions.
